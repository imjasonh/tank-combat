# Tank Combat — Rules

## Overview

Players command tanks, loading and firing munitions to destroy each other. In a **Duel** (2 players), reduce your opponent to 0 HP. In a **Deathmatch** (3+), be the first to score 3 kills.

## Tank Classes

All tanks have **100 HP**. At **25 HP or below**, Adrenaline activates: clear all your hazards and gain a powerful new ability (replacing your passive).

| Class | Hand Size | Passive | Adrenaline |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Heavy** | 5 | -5 incoming damage | Attacks ignore Ablative Armor & Smoke |
| **Medium** | 6 | Free discard-and-draw once/turn | Load *and* Fire in one turn |
| **Light** | 10 | More cards, more options | Attackers must discard a card to target you |

## Cards (100-card deck)

**Munitions** — Load into your breech, then fire on a later turn.
- **High Explosive** (12x) — 25 damage
- **Anti-Tank** (6x) — 50 damage, ignores and removes up to 1 Ablative Armor.
- **Armor Piercing** (2x) — 75 damage

**Other Offense**
- **Fire!** (15x) — Discard to fire whatever's in your breech at a target.
- **Coaxial MG** (10x) — Play directly for 10 damage (no breech needed).

**Hazards** → **Remedies** (6 of each)
- **Tracked** → **Field Repair** — Can't attack.
- **Jammed Breech** → **Clear Breech** — Can't load.
- **Comms Jammed** → **Re-establish Comms** — Can't play Smoke.

**Defenses**
- **Smoke Launchers** (10x) — Play on anyone's turn to cancel an incoming attack.
- **Ablative Armor** (6x) — Equip to absorb 10 damage from one hit, then discarded.
- **Permanent Safeties** (1x each: Reinforced Treads, Advanced Targeting, Encrypted Comms) — Equip to become immune to the matching hazard.

## Turn Structure

1. **Draw** up to your hand size limit.
2. **Take one action:**
   - **Load** a munition into your breech.
   - **Fire** (discard a Fire! card) at a target.
   - **Quick Fire** a Coaxial MG at a target.
   - **Sabotage** — play a hazard on an opponent.
   - **Repair** — remove a hazard from yourself or an ally.
   - **Equip** Ablative Armor or a Permanent Safety.
   - **Discard** 1 card (if nothing else is possible).
3. **Discard** down to your hand size limit if over.

## Interrupts

When an attack is declared, before it resolves:

- **Smoke Launchers** — Any player (if not Comms Jammed) may play Smoke to cancel the attack entirely.
- **Tactical Override** — If an opponent plays a hazard on you and you hold the matching Permanent Safety, reveal it to cancel the hazard, equip the safety, force the attacker to discard a random card, draw a card, and take a bonus turn.

## Damage Resolution

1. Start with base damage (10 / 25 / 50 / 75).
2. If the target has Ablative Armor: reduce damage by 10 and discard one armor. (HEAT instead destroys the armor with no damage reduction.)
3. If the target is Heavy and is not under Adrenaline: reduce damage by 5.
4. When target's HP reaches 0, it is destroyed.

## Death & Respawn (Deathmatch)

When a tank hits 0 HP, the attacker scores a kill mark. The destroyed tank respawns at full HP with a fresh hand, a clear tableau, and a **Spawn Shield** (immune until the start of their next turn).

## Deck Recycling

When the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
